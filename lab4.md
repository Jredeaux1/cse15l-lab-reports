## __Lab Report 4: JayLynne Redeaux ðŸ§ __
Step One: To log into ieng6 I typed `cs15lsp23kv@ieng6.ucsd.edu` then pressed `<enter>` since I previously set up my SSH key, I did not have to enter a password. The image below shows the screen when entering ieng6.

Step Two: The next step is to clone the repository into my directory. I did this by doing `<command v>` which placed `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7` into my terminal. From there is was important that  made sure the clone was sucessful, I did this by typing `ls` then changing my directory into lab7 using the command `cd lab7` as seen below.

Step 3: Prior to fixing the code, I made sure to run the test to make sure they are currently failing. I did this by tying `bash test.sh` into my command line followed by `<enter>` the output is shown below.

Step 4: It is now time to fix this error, we have to go into vim first by typing `vim ListExamples.java` which opens up the editor. Keys pressed: `<down>` x47 `<left>` x3 once I got to the spot where I was hovering over the 1, I pressed `x` once to delete it. To go into insert mode and to edit: Keys pressed ~ `i` `2`. Finally, before testing if the edits worked. I saved my work. Keys pressed: `<esc> :wq! <enter>` . As you can see in the photo below, the changes have been saved.

Step 5: To test the changes, `<up><up><enter>`  command was 2 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it. As you can see in the image below,the tests ran sucessfully

Finally, the last step 6: save all the work by commiting to main. I did this by typing `git commit ListExamples.java` which then opened another vim insert menu where I was able to type my message to go along with my commit. Once I was done typing I saved and exited doing `<esc>:wq!<enter>`
